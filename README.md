# .github - A Hidden Gem in Repository Management

The .github repository serves as a centralized storage location for all GitHub meta files within the [_infrashift >>](https://github.com/infrashift) organization. 

By consolidating these files in one place, the .github repository helps eliminate redundant copy-pasting across repositories, streamlining management and saving valuable resources. Moreover, all community health files within this repository are automatically linked to and accessible from all repositories under the infrashift umbrella. When a repository contains a well-known community health file type it overrides the reference to the same file type in this repository.

To learn more about this feature and the supported functionality it offers, refer to [the official GitHub documentation on creating community heath files](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file#supported-file-types). Embrace the power of the `.github` repository; Help save digital trees!
